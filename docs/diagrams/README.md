## Parks Data Register Diagrams

These diagrams are meant to support user flow and data in the park data register. They can be used for reference in creation of user interfaces and to help understand how items move through the states in the data register. They are not representative of the formal legislative protected area planning process and are subject to change.

Diagrams are saved in `.svg` format. This way, they can be observed in their current form in GitHub's viewer.

If you wish to edit the diagrams, you can import them in their `.svg` format into [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/), where you can make your changes. Export as `.svg` and commit back to GitHub so the diagrams remain up-to-date with a change log.
