## Parks Data Register Diagrams

Diagrams are saved in `.svg` format. This way, they can be observed in their current form in GitHub's viewer.

If you wish to edit the diagrams, you can import them in their `.svg` format into [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/), where you can make your changes. Export as `.svg` and commit back to GitHub so the diagrams remain up-to-date with a change log.
